A task tracker application in React is a simple web application that allows users to track and manage tasks or to-do items. It provides a user interface where users can add tasks, mark tasks as completed, and delete tasks. The application typically consists of a form to add new tasks, a list to display existing tasks, and buttons or checkboxes to mark tasks as completed or delete them.
